  **🚀 I am Thomas Hein Thura**  
 🔹 **Technical Manager & Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) | Kubernetes, WSO2 & Cloud-Native Architect**   

I am a results-driven Technical Manager and **Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT)** with deep expertise in architecting and operating enterprise-grade platforms across **Kubernetes, DevOps, API Management, and Data Engineering**. I specialize in designing scalable, secure, and highly available infrastructure in hybrid, multi-cloud, and on-premises environments for mission-critical industries like banking, telecom, and media.  

- 🏗️ **Platform Engineering:** I build and lead the development of robust, production-grade Kubernetes clusters (EKS, AKS, Arc-enabled) and modernize legacy systems by migrating them to cloud-native microservices. A key project involved deploying WSO2 on AWS Kubernetes for a major streaming platform, **cutting API latency by over 70%**.
- 🚀 **DevOps & GitOps:** I architect modern CI/CD pipelines grounded in GitOps principles (Argo CD, FluxCD) and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Crossplane) to automate and accelerate the software delivery lifecycle.  
- 🔐 **Security & Observability:** I implement comprehensive security and observability stacks, utilizing tools like Cilium and Kyverno for policy enforcement and the ELK Stack, Prometheus, and Grafana for full-stack monitoring.  
- 👨‍🏫 **Leadership & Mentorship:** As an MCT, I am passionate about empowering technical teams. I have led a cross-functional team of 11 engineers, mentored 7+ interns in DevOps and DBA roles, and delivered over a dozen technical training sessions on Kubernetes, WSO2, and cloud technologies.
