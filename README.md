 🔹 **Technical Manager & Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) | Kubernetes, WSO2 & Cloud-Native Architect** 


**📍 About Me**

I am a Technical Manager and Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) specializing in architecting the high-performance, resilient infrastructure that powers modern enterprises. My expertise lies at the intersection of Kubernetes, WSO2 middleware, and multi-cloud DevOps, where I lead strategic initiatives to modernize legacy systems and build scalable, secure solutions for mission-critical industries.  

 * 🏗️ I build: Scalable, cloud-native systems on Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, On-Premise) and design enterprise-grade API ecosystems with WSO2.  

 * 🚀 I specialize in: Migrating monolithic applications to microservices, implementing Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and building robust GitOps CI/CD pipelines (Argo CD).  

 * 📊 I am passionate about: Full-stack observability (ELK, Prometheus), data integrity, and architecting solutions that are both powerful and maintainable.  

 * 👨‍🏫 As an MCT, I am dedicated to empowering technical teams with the skills needed to manage and innovate upon cutting-edge cloud technologies.
